# TSPI Challenge - Aric Repp

## Project Description

For this project, I was tasked to create a small web app that created Pokemon cards from an API. These cards needed to be arranged and detailed using the API. For the base challenge I would also need to be able to search through my cards. As a bonus challenge, I was also able to include a Battle feature which upon choosing 2 cards would determine a winner. A small add on that I included was the addition of 1 card would appear as a 'Shiny' Pokemon, appearing with a different image and background.

## Technical Description

I chose React as my front end framework of choice. From the prompt I decided to take the initiative and do a small design update using a modern design framework Ant Design.

The stack I used consisted of:

- React
- Redux (Toolkit)
- AntD (Design Framework)
